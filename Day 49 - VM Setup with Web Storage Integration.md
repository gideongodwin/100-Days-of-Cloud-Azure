## Day 49 - VM Setup with Web Storage Integration

## Task Details:
The Nautilus DevOps team is tasked with setting up an environment to host a static web application. The application will serve static content from an Azure Storage Account, and a Virtual Machine (VM) will be configured to fetch and display this content using Nginx. The Azure Storage Account is used as a secure, centralized location for storing the index.html file. The team intentionally keeps this file outside the main source code repository, since that repository contains additional internal application code that should not be exposed to or accessed by the VM. By placing only the required static file in the Storage Account, the team can distribute this asset safely and independently of the full codebase.

The VM should securely download the index.html blob directly from the designated container (e.g., using Azure CLI, SAS URL, or REST API) and place it in Nginx’s web root directory so that it is served locally by Nginx. The Storage Account is not mounted, and the Static Website feature is not used. The VM retrieves the file during deployment and may re-fetch it whenever updates are needed. The resources must follow best practices for security, performance, and accessibility.


Task Details:
1) Create a Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet:

Create a VNet named devops-vnet in the East US region.
Create a subnet named devops-subnet within the VNet for the VM.
2) Create an Azure Storage Account:

Create a storage account named devopsstor6110 in the East US region with Locally-redundant storage (LRS).
Create a Blob container named devops-container in the storage account.
Upload the index.html file located at /root on the client host to the container devops-container.
Ensure the Storage Account is private and not publicly accessible by disabling public access for the storage account.
3) Create a Virtual Machine (VM):

Create a VM named devops-vm in the East US region.

Use the devops-vnet and subnet devops-subnet for the VM.

Authentication: Use SSH public key authentication. (Please select use existing public key option, create public-key locally and paste contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

Install Nginx on the VM.

Download the index.html file using a command such as:

sudo az storage blob download --account-name devopsstor6110 --account-key xxxxx --container-name devops-container --name index.html --file /var/www/html/index.html

Ensure Nginx is configured to serve the file from /var/www/html/index.html.

4) Verify Setup:

Verify that the Nginx web server on the client host serves the index.html file correctly when accessing the VM's public IP address.
Note: Follow best practices for security, accessibility, and performance while configuring resources. Use below given Azure Portal Credentials:
